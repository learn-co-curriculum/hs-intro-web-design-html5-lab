# Add Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML makes our lives way easier. We can stop labeling things with IDs and classes. We like our code to be as readable as possible, and labeled correctly. Labeling our code with HTML5 Semantic tags lets Google properly return our website for the correct search results. Semantic tags is how Google knows the NYTimes is full of `articles` and that restaurants have a `menu`.

## Let's Get To Work

In `index.html`, you'll find a website full of non-semantic tags. This website isn't styled at all, so you don't need to worry about viewing the site in the browser.

Your job is to change out the `div` tags for the correct HTML5 semantic tags.
